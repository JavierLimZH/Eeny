# Eeny

### Installation

Tested on Python 3.10 with Lark 1.1.5. 

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Lark is used for parsing the grammar.

### Rule 110

The simulation of Rule 110 can be found in `main.py`. Run with `python main.py`.

It simulates N Rule 110 cells, printing each generation to the terminal. A black square is an off state, a white square is an on state.

N by default is 100, but can be changed at the top of the file.

### Syntax

A brief outline of the syntax can be found in `syntax.md`.
